# SKALE Network: Open Source Plan and Community

SKALE Network would be nothing without the open source community - the community stands on the shoulders of giants. As SKALE Labs begins the process of open sourcing everything, the Network would like to extend a thank you to everyone in the community who has made this technology possible. Also thank you to the Aleth Project (which our skaled code is based on) and its many contributors.

Most projects in this space led with a whitepaper and followed up (or not) with execution. SKALE Network is fortunate to have investors who recognized that shipping and open sourcing were a higher priority and allowed SKALE Labs to focus on those items, first.

Over the course of many months, the community and related processes evolved and changed with everyone's ability to prepare for open sourcing - it was a messy. So, it was decided to clear the commit histories of pre ~mid-2019 repositories so that minimums for clean and secure code practices could be met.

SKALE Network still working on improving and cleaning things up, and as a result, there is a phased open sourcing process to ensure that the Network ship's the best code for the community to begin contributing to.

Dates are tentative (as with any software development), but here are the things planned for release in the near future (in no particular order).
